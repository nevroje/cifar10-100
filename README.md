- We first load images into our program
- These images are stored in a place where the program can access it
- We need Python to make sense of the information that is present so we do the process of normalization
- We define the foundation of the neural network 
- Defining the loss function to ensure we obtain maximum accuracy on the dataset
- Training the actual model to learn something about the data that it has seen all this while
testing the model to analyze the accuracy and iterate through the training process to achieve better accuracy
